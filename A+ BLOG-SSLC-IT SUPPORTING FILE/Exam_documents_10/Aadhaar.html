<h3>How To Update Aadhar</h3>

<p class="new">
  <b>A</b>ll Aadhaar card holders can make changes to their Aadhaar card, if required, till September 14. To update your Aadhaar details online, you can visit the UIDAI website at <u>https://myaadhaar.uidai.gov.in/portal</u>. You will need to provide your Aadhaar number and other required information.
In the official document issued by the UIDAI, it earlier said, “In order to encourage more residents to update their document in Aadhaar, it was decided to provide the provision to update their document in Aadhaar through myAadhaar portal free of cost up to September 14.” But as per the recent update, it’s been extended to 14th December, 2023.
The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) is asking residents to update their Aadhaar cards, especially if they were issued 10 years ago and have not been updated since then. This is to ensure that the demographic details on the Aadhaar card are accurate and up-to-date. Accurate demographic details help to improve service delivery and enhance the success rate of authentication.
