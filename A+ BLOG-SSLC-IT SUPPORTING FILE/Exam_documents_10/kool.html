 KITE's Open Online Learning</h2>
<h3>KOOL</h3>
<p>
As part of Public Education Rejuvenation Mission, all class rooms in secondary and higher secondary sections in the State of Kerala has been converted as Hi-Tech class rooms and IT/ICT enabled education has become a reality. But deputing teachers for different training programmes in working days adversely affects the academic days and academic activities of students. Now-a-days Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) are very popular and is much effective. In line with this – KITE has developed a special tool for online courses/training; KITE's OPEN ONLINE LEARNING – KOOL., an online general tool to impart training/ courses to teachers, students, parents and public.</P>
