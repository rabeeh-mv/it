<h3>Kerala schools switch to K-FON for free internet services</h3>

<p class="new">
  <B>KITE (Kerala Infrastructure and Technology for Education)</B> has ended its collaboration with BSNL on providing internet services to public schools in the state. The move comes in the backdrop of the government's plan to introduce the Kerala Fiber Optic Network (KFON) in state-run institutions, including schools.

KITE has decided not to rely on BSNL after their contract ended on March 31, 2023. Until last month, the government relied on BSNL to provide internet services to 4473 schools in the state as part of the government's Hi-Tech school programme.
However, those schools yet to instal KFON facilities will have to continue using BSNL services and have to bear the cost. The government is trying to bring the facility to schools as fast as possible to avoid this situation.
