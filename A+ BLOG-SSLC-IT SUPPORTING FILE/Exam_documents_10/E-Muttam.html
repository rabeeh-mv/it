<h3>E-Muttam: Empowering Kerala’s Digitally Illiterate</h3>
<h4>
   Olavanna Grama Panchayat’s Digital Literacy Programme Set for Launch</h4>
<br>
<br>
<p class="new">
   E-Muttam is a project aimed at providing basic technical knowledge to people of all sections in the digital sector. Digital illiterates above the age of 15 years will be identified, and digital literacy will be ensured. In the first phase, those lacking basic digital literacy in one local self-government institution in each district will be identified, made literate, and integrated into the local self-governing body. The project is being implemented jointly by the Literacy Mission Authority and KITE.

A digital survey will be organized to identify the learners. The objective of the project is to make the common people primarily aware of the digital sector and enable them to handle computers, the internet, smartphones, and other social media platforms.<br>

The curriculum includes teaching the use of digital devices and apps, creating awareness about their pros and cons, establishing an email ID for everyone, and training the government on digital services, online ticket booking, and online bill payment. NSS volunteers, volunteers, Kudumbashree workers, and Anganwadi workers will act as instructors.

The scheme comprises people’s representatives, various non-governmental representatives, social volunteers, educational activists, representatives of educational institutions, and individuals proficient in the IT sector.<br>

The project will help the common people understand the potential of the Internet in their daily lives, identify the benefits and misuse of digital systems, learn to identify fake social media accounts, fake news from Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook, and email, and find solutions to cyber-related issues themselves.
