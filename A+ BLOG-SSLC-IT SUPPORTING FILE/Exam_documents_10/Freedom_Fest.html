   THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Freedom Fest 2023, a free knowledge fair organised by the state government, will be extended to all districts by giving priority to students, Festival Academic Committee chairman T M Thomas Issac has said. He was speaking at the concluding session of the four-day festival that came to an end on Tuesday at the Tagore Theatre in Thiruvananthapuram. 
“The fest will be continued in the coming years in all districts by giving delegation to students. Nodal officers from the educational institutions will plan how to organise fairs in the districts. Freedom Fest will be considered every two years. For this, the Free Knowledge Democratic Alliance (DAKF) will act as an accelerator of knowledge freedom,” Issac said.
General Education Minister V Sivankutty said that the education department is implementing special projects to improve English language learning by making maximum use of advanced technology in the state’s schools. He was addressing the digital conclave of the Freedom Fest.
