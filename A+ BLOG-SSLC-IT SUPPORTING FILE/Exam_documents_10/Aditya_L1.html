<h3>Aditya-L1: Indiaâ€™s first mission of the Sun</h3>
<h4>
India has launched its first observation mission to the Sun, just days after the country made history by becoming the first to land near the Moon's south pole.</h4>

<p class="new">
  Aditya-L1 lifted off from the launch pad at Sriharikota on Saturday at 11:50 India time (06:20 GMT). It will travel 1.5 million km (932,000 miles) from the Earth - 1% of the Earth-Sun distance. India's space agency says it will take four months to travel that far.
India's first space-based mission to study the Solar System's biggest object is named after Surya - the Hindu god of Sun who is also known as Aditya. And L1 stands for Lagrange point 1 - the exact place between the Sun and Earth where the Indian spacecraft is heading.
According to the European Space Agency, a Lagrange point is a spot where the gravitational forces of two large objects - such as the Sun and the Earth - cancel each other out, allowing a spacecraft to "hover". Once Aditya-L1 reaches this "parking spot", it would be able to orbit the Sun at the same rate as the Earth. This means the satellite will require very little fuel to operate.
