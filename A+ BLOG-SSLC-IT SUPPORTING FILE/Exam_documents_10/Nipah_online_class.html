<h3>Nipah outbreak | Online classes for students in Kozhikode’s containment zones</h3>
<h4>
    Kerala Infrastructure and Technology for Education arranges classes through G-Suite platform</h4>
<br>
<br>
<p class="blue">
   General Education Minister V. Sivankutty on Wednesday directed Director of General Education Shanavas S. to arrange online classes so that students in schools within containment zones declared in connection with the Nipah outbreak in Kozhikode district could attend lessons sitting at home.
Accordingly, the Kerala Infrastructure and Technology for Education (KITE) has been entrusted with making the arrangements for online classes using its G-Suite platform.<br>
KITE had rolled out the G-Suite for Education platform in 2021 to facilitate online classes during the pandemic. Now, in the wake of the Nipah outbreak, G-Suite has been made available on the public domain kiteschool.in. There is no need to provide any sensitive data pertaining to students such as UID, mobile number, or email for G-Suite, over which KITE will have complete master control.<br>
Teachers can log into the portal using their ‘PEN’ number, while students can use their school code and admission number. Only students registered on the Sampoorna portal can log into G-Suite. Except for those allowed by teachers, no one from outside can take part in the online classes. As a result, students’ privacy and online safety are ensured.
